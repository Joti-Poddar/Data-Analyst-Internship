I have taken the data from chat gpt and learn from different resource how to transform data, create measures, create columns, create table and dashbord using DAX. I have tried to implement them all in my dashboard.

I have worked on sales data. i have learned multiple things like formatting, filtering, data cleaning using pivot table, logical functions, vlook up etc.
I am trying my best to learn the things and implement them all.
